CLI Tamogotchi Project
=======================
Uses 'readline' to create a text interface in the console for playing a tamogotchi game.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the directory in a terminal
3. Type 'npm install' and press enter.
4. Now type 'npm run start'
5. Enjoy the game!

## Technologies

I used nodemon for dev, node.js runs the application and the only crucial dependency is readline.

## Process

Tried and true coding and experimenting.

## Licence

Do what you want with it!

## Future Features

I plan on adding:
- Tamogotchi will gain hunger and lose happiness over time if not cared for.
- Save properties to local machine to remember stats.
- Add animations of some sort.
- Add failure state: Death!
- Add sickness from hunger and medicine to cure.
